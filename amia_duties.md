# AMIA Duties

## Introduction

This document is intended to distill the requirements and recommendations of various AMIA entities as expressed in the governing documents of AMIA for the purpose of summarizing how AMIA works. Contributions here should be clear as to:

- if the duty is a mandate ("must", "required", "shall") or recommendation ("recommended", "should"),
- the AMIA entity that is responsible (ie. AMIA Office, AMIA Board, Awards Committee, etc),
- citation to the associated governing document including the full name, file modification date, and page number.

In some cases, very similar duties are expressed in multiple documents. In these case each variance is presented.
